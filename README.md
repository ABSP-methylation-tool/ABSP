# ABSP
ABSP, standing for *"Analysis of Bisulfite Sequencing PCR"*, is an R based tool to analyze methylation profiles using data from Bisulfite Sequencing PCR (BSP) experiment results. 
It was developed to help researchers to estimate and compare methylation percentages of a DNA region studied using BSP experiments. 
It provides a complete automated workflow, from trace file sequencing results to data visualization and statistics.
