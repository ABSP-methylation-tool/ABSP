# ABSP - Analysis of Bisulfite Sequencing PCR

<img src="./documents/logo.png" width="200" />

ABSP, standing for *"Analysis of Bisulfite Sequencing PCR"*, is an R based tool to analyze CpG methylation profiles using data from Bisulfite Sequencing PCR (BSP) experiment results. 
It was developed to help researchers to estimate and compare methylation percentages of a DNA region studied using BSP experiments. 
It provides a complete automated workflow, from trace file sequencing results to data visualization and statistics.

For more detailed information, please read the [**ABSP User Guide**](https://github.com/ABSP-methylation-tool/ABSP/blob/813568d14944b20488cc01582a61dfbd602f744c/ABSP%20User%20Guide.pdf) document.

## Availability

ABSP was developed on a Windows machine but is functional on MacOS and Linux devices. Please note that the installation of packages at the first opening of ABSP on a Linux machine can take a long time.

## Quick start guide

### Installation

* Download the ABSP files from github ("Code", "Download Zip") and unzip the folder
* Install the software: R at [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio at [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Open the ABSP app

* Open the "ABSP Rproject.Rproject" file with Rstudio
* Open the "app.R" file with Rstudio
* Click on the "Run App" button on the top right corner (you can select "Run external" to open it in web browser)

### Analysis with ABSP

Find example data of inputs and outputs in the "examples" folder.

#### Individual sample analysis: 
* In the "Individual analysis" tab, fill the entries and add input files (reference sequence .fasta file and sequencing .ab1 files)
* Run the analysis to compute the CpG methylation levels of your sample 
* View the results in the .html report generated in your "reports" folder
* Look for output files in your "results" folder

#### Grouped samples analysis:
* Once all of your samples have been individually analyzed, in the "Grouped analysis" tab, fill the entries and choose your parameters for plotting
* Run the analysis to gather samples, generate visualization plots (lollipop plots) and compare methylation data between groups by comparative statistics
* View the results in the .html report generated in your "reports" folder
* Look for output files in your "results" folder

#### Launch multiple analysis:  
The "Multiple analysis" tab is useful to analyze multiple samples and/or for multiple grouping analysis, launched in one click, using as input tables filled with the required input entries.
