# ABSP - Analysis of Bisulfite Sequencing PCR
ABSP, standing for *"Analysis of Bisulfite Sequencing PCR"*, is an R based tool to analyze CpG methylation profiles using data from Bisulfite Sequencing PCR (BSP) experiment results. 
It was developed to help researchers to estimate and compare methylation percentages of a DNA region studied using BSP experiments. 
It provides a complete automated workflow, from trace file sequencing results to data visualization and statistics.

For more detailed information, please read the "ABSP User Guide" document.

To use ABSP :

* Download all the ABSP files ("Code", "Download Zip")
* Install R and RStudio
* Open the "ABSP Rproject.Rproject" file with Rstudio (it might take a few minutes to open)
